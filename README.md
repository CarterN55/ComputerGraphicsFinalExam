I used the hologram shader on the ghosts (visualized with a capsule) to show when they are able to be eaten by Pac-Man. In the original game they flash when weakened but for this project I wanted a hologram to show their defences lowering (decending lines on the hologram).


**Scrolling**

Its hard to tell in the picture but I used the scrolling shader to create a spiraling effect on the powerup dots (the ones you eat to eat the ghosts) to give them a more impactful look. Sadly they only show the spiral well in the editor and not in game view because it makes them more choppy and not as smooth.
